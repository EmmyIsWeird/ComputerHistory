      <h1>The Invention of Computer Punch Cards </h1>
      <br>

      They were used for storing data for the computers.</p>

      <h2>What were they used for? How did they "store" data?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Punch cards were used for to store data and information for people and the computers.<br>
      The punch card "stored" data when it had whole punched into the paper card. The wholes would <br>
      be put in certain order to represent certain data.</p>
      <br>  
      <br>
      <p>Computer Punch Cards were very useful at the time. They did not store very much data.<br>
      Since they could not store much data, the punch cards were made by the milions. If you had a stack<br>
      of punch cards with data in order, you would have to be very careful to keep them in order.<br>
      If they fell you wouldn't know the order. You would have to make new ones.</p>1
