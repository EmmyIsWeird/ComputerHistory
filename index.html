      <h2>What were they used for? How did they "store" data?</h2>
      <p>Punch cards were used for to store data and information for people and the computers.<br>
      The punch card "stored" data when it had hole punched into the paper card. The holes would <br>
      be put in certain order to represent certain data.
      <br>  
      <br>
      Computer Punch Cards were very useful at the time. They did not store very much data.<br>
      Since they could not store much data, the punch cards were made by the millions. If you had a stack<br>
      of punch cards with data in order, you would have to be very careful to keep them in order.<br>
      If they fell you wouldn't know the order. You would have to make new ones.</p>

      <h1>Herman Hollerith's Life</h1>
      <p>Herman Hollerith was born in Buffalo, New York, U.S. Februrary 29, 1860. He took his education at the <br>
      Columbia University School of Mines. He graduated from the school in 1879. Immediately after graduating, <br>
      Mr. Hollerith became an assistent teacher. He worked alongside his teacher William P. Trowbridge. He briefly <br>
      taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1890 he had invented machines to record statistics <br>
      by reading punched cards of information. <br> <br>
       
       The invention of Computer Punch Cards was a success in the U.S. It was <br>
      an even bigger hit in Europe where it was widely adopted for a large amount of statistic purposes. In the year <br>
      1896 Herman organized an offical company. It was called the Tabulating Machine Company. It was rooted in New York. <br>
      It eventually grew larger and became the International Buisness machines Corporation (IBM).  <br><br>
       
      Herman married on September 15, 1890. He married Beverley Talcott. They had six child named Virginia, <br>
      Richard, Charles, Nannie, Lucia, Herman Jr. Sadly Herman Hollerith died from a heart attack, in Washington <br>
      D.C. He passed away on November 17, 1929 at the age of 69.

      <h1>Who invented the Computer Punch Card?</h1>
      <p>It was first invented by Herman Hollerith. The New York City Board of Health first <br>
      tested using them for vital statistics tabulation. After being successfully tested,<br>
      computer punch cards were adopted for use in  the 1890 census.</p>
    
      <h2>Where did his idea for the invention come from?</h2>
      <p>His idea of punching holes in a medium to store information did not just <br>
      pop into his head randomly one day. The idea came from seeing punched cards used<br>
      to control Jacquard looms. In France, 1810, Jacquard originated the idea of using<br>
       a punched card for controlling weaving looms. </p>
