      <h1 id="title">The Invention of Computer Punch Cards </h1>
      <br>
      <p>Punch cards were used back when the first computers were made.<br> 
      They were used for storing data for the computers.</p>

      <h2>What were they used for? How did they "store" data?</h2>
      <p>Punch cards were used for to store data and information for people and the computers.<br>
      The punch card "stored" data when it had whole punched into the paper card. The holes would <br>
      be put in certain order to represent certain data.
      <br>  
      <br>
      Computer Punch Cards were very useful at the time. They did not store very much data.<br>
      Since they could not store much data, the punch cards were made by the millions. If you had a stack<br>
      of punch cards with data in order, you would have to be very careful to keep them in order.<br>
      If they fell you wouldn't know the order. You would have to make new ones.</p>

      <h1>Who invented the Computer Punch Card?</h1>
      <p>It was first invented by Herman Hollerith. The New York City Board of Health first <br>
      tested using them for vital statistics tabulation. After being successfully tested,<br>
      computer punch cards were adopted for use in  the 1890 census.</p>
    
      <h2>Where did his idea for the invention come from?</h2>
      <p>His idea of punching wholes in a medium to store information did not just <br>
      pop into his head randomly one day. The idea came from seeing punched cards used<br>
      to control Jacquard looms. In France, 1810, Jacquard originated the idea of using<br>
      a punched card for controlling weaving looms. </p>
