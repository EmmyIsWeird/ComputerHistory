      <h1>Who invented the Computer Punch Card?</h1>
      <p>It was first invented by Herman Hollerith. The New York City Board of Health first <br>
      tested using them for vital statistics tabulation. After being successfully tested,<br>
      computer punch cards were adopted for use in  the 1890 census.</p>
    
      <h2>Where did his idea for the invention come from?</h2>
      <p>His idea of punching holes in a medium to store information did not just <br>
      pop into his head randomly one day. The idea came from seeing punched cards used<br>
      to control Jacquard looms. In France, 1810, Jacquard originated the idea of using<br>
       a punched card for controlling weaving looms. </p>
